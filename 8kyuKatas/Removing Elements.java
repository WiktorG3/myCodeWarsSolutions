/*
Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.
Example:
["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]
None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!
